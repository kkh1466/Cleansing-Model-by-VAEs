# Pulsatile Physiological Signal Imputation using VAE
This repository contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model for handling missing data in Pulsatile Physiological Signals. The model takes normal signals, introduces missing values, and restores them to their original state.

# Environment Setup:
CUDA: 12.3  
cuDNN: 8.9.7  
TensorFlow: 2.16.1  
The GPVAE model has been upgraded to TensorFlow 2.16.1 to resolve memory issues. The previous training codes were written in an older version of TensorFlow.

A Docker image containing the environment is available:
